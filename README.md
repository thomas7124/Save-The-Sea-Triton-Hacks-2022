# Save-The-Seas-Triton-Hacks

Coral Reefs are very cool, and visualizing them with data is even cooler.
This repo displays an interactive map with every deep sea coral plotted in the world.

# IMPORTANT

For the code to work, you will need to download the data set provided, and add it to the same directory as the python file.
It's too big to add to github. The data set has almost 900 thousand entries, which makes the file size extremely large. We added a compression system which brought the file size from 300 mb to 1 mb. The compressed version is called "new_coral.csv"

The data set is a compressed veresion of :https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/deep-sea-corals/mapSites.htm
We took out parts we did not need so the data set wouldn't be 300 mb.

# The Use

For this project, you will have to first add the data set provided above.

**See the map at its highest quality**

-  Run display_full.py

**See the map in its compressed form**
